    "## 7. Key Concepts Summary 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI Agents are Specialized Workers**: Each agent has a specific job (answer questions, evaluate quality, route escalations, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Workflows Connect Agents**: Like an assembly line, agents pass work to each other in a specific order\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Management**: The system keeps track of the conversation, user context, and decisions made\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: When AI isn't enough, the system smoothly hands off to human experts\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Configuration-Driven**: The system uses files to configure different AI models and behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Framework for building multi-agent workflows\n",
    "- **LangChain**: Library for working with language models\n",
    "- **LangSmith**: Monitoring and tracing for AI applications\n",
    "- **Multiple LLMs**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models\n",
    "- **SQLite**: Database for storing conversation context\n",
    "- **Python**: Programming language for the entire system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of system is used in:\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Automated help with human escalation\n",
    "- **Technical Documentation**: AI-powered help systems\n",
    "- **Educational Platforms**: Personalized tutoring with teacher oversight\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Initial screening with doctor consultation\n",
    "- **Legal Services**: Document review with lawyer validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue learning:\n",
    "1. **Explore the Code**: Look at the actual implementation in `/workspace/src/`\n",
    "2. **Run the Tests**: Try `make test` to see how the system is tested\n",
    "3. **Modify Configuration**: Change `/workspace/config/` files to customize behavior\n",
    "4. **Build Your Own**: Create new agents following the patterns you've learned\n",
    "5. **Study LangGraph**: Learn more about building multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: AI agents are just programs that make decisions and take actions. The \"intelligence\" comes from the language models they use and how they're connected together!"
