Project Title :-  
Orchestrating Intelligence: A Master Module for Human-AI Hybrid Systems


Project Objective (<250 words)

Current AI support systems often frustrate users by failing to recognize when human intervention is necessary and by not connecting them with the most suitable human expert. This leads to poor customer and employee satisfaction.

Our project proposes a "hybrid team" model where AI and humans collaborate dynamically for superior customer service. We will develop a prototype demonstrating this intelligent support ecosystem.

The system features a live dashboard monitoring customer and employee sentiment and AI confidence in real-time. When the AI struggles, our "Intelligent Escalation Engine" routes the customer to the optimal human expert. This engine analyzes the problem's context to match the customer with an expert based on skills, availability, and historical success, ensuring a transparent and efficient handoff.

A key aspect is the continuous learning loop: every successful human resolution is captured as a high-quality training example for the AI. Additionally, higher-level human experts evaluate the performance of both the AI and the junior human, as well as the specific AI-human combination. This feedback mechanism ensures the entire system, both human and AI, continuously improves. Our demo will showcase a more effective human-AI interaction model that significantly enhances customer experience and provides a robust framework for collaboration.

Our modular system is designed for integration with existing platforms. For instance, we could fork an open-source repository, insert hooks into critical code areas, and use our module to enhance the hybrid Human-AI team, thereby improving human utilization and customer satisfaction.


Detailed Project Description

Our plan is to build a “master-control-module” for improving user satisfaction when interfacing with an AI system that can be integrated into existing applications.


One key feature we are considering is an “Intelligent Escalation Engine” that will assist in routing escalation events to the best human option based on various factors, such as:
the profile of the human, including seniority, skill set, etc…
their current availability
The current demand for senior or junior humans
Their probability of success based upon the AI’s analysis of previous records with similar questions


As part of this, there will be a tiered level of humans (senior, junior, etc..) where the “senior” humans will evaluate the performance of not only the AI, but the junior humans and the AI-human joint efforts, and this data will be part of the feedback and training loop to improve the overall human-AI hybrid team.


Such a system would result in better user satisfaction since it would reduce how many attempts are required to get a satisfactory response, and it would increase employee satisfaction by assigning them only issues they are best prepared to handle and to balance their work load more appropriately.


We envision something like this:


We integrate our module into an existing application. Some ideas are:
We fork an open-source application, such as a customer support chatbot, and we add hooks or links to key parts of the software.
We intercept and reroute api calls to our module
We create an MCP server to so that we can directly bridge with existing agentic apps


The module will analyze the user inquiry and evaluate whether it should be immediately escalated to humans or assigned to an appropriate AI or AI agent.


If assigned to an AI agent, the module will monitor (and record) the interaction and attempt to determine how well the AI agent is performing. If it detects frustration or other warning signs from the user, it will escalate to human intervention.


Once escalated to human level intervention, the module will analyze the user and AI responses to determine the “best” or most “optimal” human to route the inquiry to.


The exchanges are logged for later review by more “senior” humans that will evaluate the performance of the AI, the human, how well the escalation occurred (too early, too late, to the “right” human, etc…)


This information will be included in appropriate training files for both immediate use (such as adding it to the context window, directly contacting the junior human to explain the appropriate response, etc…) and for later re-training of the models


The system will analyze this incoming training data and determine appropriate corrective actions, which may include: adversarial training, contextual conditioning, skill gap analysis, etc…


The system will be “tunable” to balance various antagonistic goals. For example, the quicker the system escalates inquiries to a human, then the longer the wait times will be waiting for humans to become available. Delayed escalation, though, may result in user frustration when they get stuck in a loop with the chatbot.


The data will be fed into a dashboard of some sort to monitor and help analyze performance metrics (wait times, number of escalation events, resolution times, etc…) as well as user and employee satisfaction via factors like sentiment, surveys, etc..


The idea is to have an almost “plug-and-play” module that can integrate into existing software to create optimized Human-AI hybrid teams, and since it functions as a master module, it can control the routing to other sub-modules and AI agents to expand capability over time.


Describe the Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk/challenge is that our models/algorithms might fail to deliver improved performance and it might not be possible to achieve this in the timeframe provided.

Another challenge is to effectively demonstrate the value of the system beyond simple dashboard performance metrics, like customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction, without real data to work with.


Estimated Milestones

Establishing an evaluation platform/preliminary dashboard to see if our model is improving

Improving the model to a satisfactory state.

Setting up a working demo to demonstrate the model.


What resources will be required?

Base AI models - either foundational or pre-trained specialized models to use as a core.

We will need to find an open source app that we can integrate our module into.


Describe the final deliverables

Performance Tracking Dashboard - track performance of our module, hopefully in real time, show key metrics (accuracy, number of events, avg resolution time, etc… for AI, Human, Hybrid teams)

Working demo - demonstrating the module in action. for example a human executing a task Vs AI agents executing it Vs hybrid’s model execution
